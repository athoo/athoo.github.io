Links

pseudo-selector
a:link

a:visited

a:hover

text-decoration:none;

a:nth-child(n) # a refers type to be selected, not the parent node


var nn = new Object() # declare a new object and send it to nn

always declare a object before use it(like sending values to it)

function is object in js, like
function Person(p1,p2){this.v1=p1;...}
var n1 = new Person(,)

when in a new constructor, whatever variable or function should be after this. symbol to make it callable by the object.
