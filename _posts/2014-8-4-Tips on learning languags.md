##The five principles

1. Focus on language content that is relevant to you
2. Use your language as a tool to communicate from day 1
3. When you understand the message you will acquire the language unconsciously
4. Language is not about accumulating a lot of knowledge but is rather a type of physiological training
5. Psycho-physiological state matters - you need to be happy, relaxed, and most importantly, you need to be tolerant of ambiguity. Don't try to understand every detail as it will drive you crazy.

##The seven actions

1. Listen a lot - it doesn't matter if you understand or not. Listen to rhythms and patterns
2. Focus on getting the meaning first, before the words. Body language and facial expressions can help
3. Start mixing, get creative, and use what you're learning
4. Focus on the core - use the most commonly - use the words, and use the language to learn more
5. Get a language parent - someone who is fluent in the language and who will do their best to understand what you mean; who will not corrent your mistakes; who will feedbac their understanding of what you're saying using correct language, and uses words that you know
6. Copy the face - watch native speakers and observe their face, and particular their mouth moves whrn they're speaking
7. "Direct connect" to the target language - find ways to connect words directly with images and other internal representations
